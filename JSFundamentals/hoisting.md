Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during compilation. For example, var and function declarations are hoisted and accessible before their actual line in code, but let and const are hoisted only in memory (temporal dead zone) and cannot be accessed before initialization. It’s important to understand this to avoid bugs related to undefined values or reference errors.
